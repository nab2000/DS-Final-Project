The goal of the Data Science Capstone project is to develop a predictive algorithm that will predict the next word in a sentence given three other words. Files containing selections of twitter, news, and blog text are being utilzied to devleop this algorithm. As a first step in this process, these files were examined to get a better understanding of the data to design the best possible algorithm 

```{r, echo = F, cache = T}
library(stringr)
library(NLP)
library(openNLP)
library(magrittr)
blog <- readLines("./final/en_US/en_US.blogs.txt")
news <- readLines("./final/en_US/en_US.news.txt")
twitter <- readLines("./final/en_US/en_US.twitter.txt")
```

The first step in this report is to process the data so that it is in a shape we cna work with. First, all of the punctuation was removed from the sentences.
